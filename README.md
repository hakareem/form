# form

This is a survey used to collect data. It is targeted at one of the project that I worked in as a team 'Snowballz'. Inside the form there are multiple options to select from that would help me get an idea of how the Snowballz game can be improved in the future.



# Areas for improvement 
• Explain how feedback will impact the game
• Use closed ended questions
• Keep it short and focused
• Keep questions simple
